                        I'm Hrak, I'm a 22 years old Full-Stack developer from
                        Los Angeles.

                    <p className={about['about-container__content']}>
                        3 years ago I made a decision to move out to Los Angeles
                        and pursue my dreams. So far Ive had the oportunity to
                        study Computer Science at Pasadena City College.
                        Meanwhile, I tried to start a career working at Apple as
                        Specialist and also had the oportuinty to do an
                        internship at Techstars, a startup incubator program.
                    </p>
                    <p className={about['about-container__content']}>
                        In 2018, I got introduced to Web Development through
                        CodeCademy and Reddit and I fell in love. The first time
                        I created a web site it made me realize my passion
                        toward building web applications.
                    </p>
                    <p className={about['about-container__content']}>
                        In 2019, I decided that after completing my classes at
                        PCC, I want to put myself into an enviornment that will
                        get my Web Development career started. That was when I
                        discovered General Assembly and decided to take the
                        Software Engineering Immersive course.
                    </p>
                    <p className={about['about-container__content']}>
                        Because the best way to learn something is just to
                        practice it, I built over 5 projects during my time at
                        GA expanding my knowledge on React, Node.js and
                        Javascript in general.
                    </p>
                    <p className={about['about-container__content']}>
                        I've always strived to do more, be more and never settle
                        learning.
                    </p>
                    <p className={about['about-container__content']}>
                        Iâ€™m hard working, super curious, passionate, committed,
                        and also a fast learner!
